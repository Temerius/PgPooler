# Main application config: listen, paths to logging, backends, routing.
#
# Optional "workers": run in dispatcher+workers mode. Dispatcher accepts TCP, reads
# first packet (user/database), resolves backend, hands off connection to the worker
# that owns that backend. Each worker has its own pool (no lock contention).
#Uncomment to enable:
workers:
  - backends: [primary]
  - backends: [replica]
